# Recommender Baselines

(This is a work in progress)

This project helps you create baseline models for recommendation systems. It is based on [MaurizioFD/RecSys2019_DeepLearning_Evaluation (DeepLearning RS Evaluation)](https://github.com/MaurizioFD/RecSys2019_DeepLearning_Evaluation) by Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema. While the original project is for comparing results on benchmark datasets, this project tries to restructure the codebase to make it adaptable for general use cases.
